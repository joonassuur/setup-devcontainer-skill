## Fork additions on top of upstream

- **Wayland clipboard rule for image-paste** — generated devcontainers now require **both** halves of the host-clipboard pipeline so Claude Code's image-paste flow actually works on Wayland hosts (Niri, Hyprland, Sway, GNOME, KDE):
  - **Dockerfile** must install `wl-clipboard` in the system packages layer (`references/dockerfile.md` → "System packages (always include)" section). This puts `wl-paste`/`wl-copy` on `PATH` inside the container.
  - **Task-runner recipe** must conditionally bind-mount `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and forward `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` + `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (`references/task-runner.md` → "Wayland clipboard mount" key design point). Without the socket, `wl-paste` runs but has nothing to talk to and Claude Code reports `"No image found in clipboard"` even though the package is installed.
  - The task-runner block is guarded by `[[ -n "${WAYLAND_DISPLAY:-}" ]]`, so it's a no-op on X11 / non-Wayland CI hosts — safe to keep in shared task runners.

Everything below this section is unchanged from upstream.

An [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) that generates hardened `.devcontainer/` setups for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) autonomous mode and IDE use (VS Code, JetBrains, DevPod, devcontainer CLI).

## What it does

When triggered, the skill analyzes your project and generates a complete [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration tailored to your toolchain. It handles the hard parts that generic devcontainer templates miss:

- **CI image reuse** — detects existing CI container images and uses them as base images via multi-stage build, keeping your dev environment in sync with CI
- **Dependency pinning** — every image uses `tag@sha256:digest`, every versioned tool gets a [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) annotation for automated updates
- **Arbitrary UID support** — works with `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` out of the box (passwd injection, sticky-bit permissions)
- **Git worktree compatibility** — mounts the project at its host-native path, no `WORKDIR`
- **SSH agent forwarding** — bind-mounts the host SSH agent socket, no raw key files
- **Claude Code integration** — native binary install, dual `~/.claude` mount workaround for plugin paths, `~/.claude.json` for preferences
- **NPM supply-chain hardening** — blocks postinstall scripts and enforces 24h package age
- **Optional network firewall** — iptables egress filter with domain allowlist for sandboxed autonomous mode
- **Task runner integration** — wraps the `docker run` invocation in a `just`/`make`/`task` recipe with `--firewall` flag
- **CI validation** — schema validation and build verification jobs triggered on `.devcontainer/` changes

## Installation

Add the skill to your Claude Code configuration. You can install it at user level (available in all projects) or project level.

**User-level** (recommended):

```bash
claude skill add --global https://gitlab.com/lx-industries/setup-devcontainer-skill
```

**Project-level** (shared with team via `.claude/skills/`):

```bash
claude skill add https://gitlab.com/lx-industries/setup-devcontainer-skill
```

Or manually clone/copy the `SKILL.md` and `references/` directory into `.claude/skills/setup-devcontainer/`.

## Usage

Ask Claude Code to set up a dev container. Any of these will trigger the skill:

- "set up a devcontainer"
- "containerize development for this project"
- "run Claude in a container"

The skill walks through 7 phases interactively, asking for your input at key decision points:

1. **Project Analysis** — identifies language, package managers, CI images, task runner
2. **Dockerfile** — generates a hardened Dockerfile with entrypoint
3. **devcontainer.json** — asks whether to share host Claude settings or start isolated
4. **CI Validation** — adds schema validation and build verification jobs
5. **Network Firewall** *(optional)* — asks if you need sandboxed mode, generates iptables egress filter
6. **Task Runner** — detects your task runner and offers to add a launch recipe
7. **Testing** — runs verification checklist inside the built container

## Firewall mode

The optional network firewall restricts all outbound traffic to an explicit domain allowlist. Domains are resolved to IPs at container start using `ipset`. The firewall self-tests by verifying that unlisted domains are blocked.

```bash
# Normal mode — full internet access
just dev-shell

# Firewalled mode — egress restricted to allowlisted domains
just dev-shell --firewall claude
```

The allowlist is auto-populated from your project's package registries and forge, plus Claude API endpoints, GitHub (Claude Code distribution), and npm (MCP server installs).
