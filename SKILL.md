# Set Up a Dev Container

Create a `.devcontainer/` setup following the [Dev Container spec](https://containers.dev/) that works for Claude Code autonomous mode (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) and as a generic IDE dev container (VS Code, JetBrains).

## Process

### Phase 1: Project Analysis

Before writing any files, investigate the project thoroughly.

**1. Identify the language ecosystem and build tools:**

```
- Primary language(s) and version(s)
- Package manager(s) and their registry URLs (cargo → crates.io, npm → registry.npmjs.org, pip → pypi.org, go → proxy.golang.org, etc.)
- Build tools (just, make, gradle, etc.)
- Task runner (justfile, Makefile, Taskfile.yml, package.json scripts)
- Required system libraries
```

Registry URLs are needed for Phase 5 (firewall allowlist) if the user opts in.

**2. Check for existing CI container images:**

Look in CI configuration, container registries, and Dockerfiles:
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `Jenkinsfile`
- `images/`, `docker/`, or similar directories
- Container registry for the project (if any)

If the project already builds CI images with the right toolchain, **reuse them as base images** via multi-stage build. This avoids duplicating toolchain setup and keeps the dev container in sync with CI.

**3. Identify additional tools needed beyond CI:**

The dev container likely needs tools CI images lack:
- Claude Code (self-contained native binary — no Node.js dependency)
- Git forge CLI (`glab`, `gh`)
- SSH client for git operations
- Any interactive development tools

**4. Check for Docker/Compose usage:**

Look for signals that the project needs Docker access inside the devcontainer:
- Compose files: `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `compose.yaml`
- Container build files: `Dockerfile` or `Containerfile` outside `.devcontainer/`
- Testcontainers dependencies in package manifests
- References to `docker build`, `docker compose`, `podman build` in task runner scripts

See [references/docker-support.md](references/docker-support.md) for the full detection signal list.

If signals found, recommend enabling Docker CLI + Compose support. If none found, still offer the option.

**5. Present findings to the user** before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Dockerfile

Generate `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and `.devcontainer/entrypoint.sh`.

See [references/dockerfile.md](references/dockerfile.md) for complete Dockerfile patterns covering: base image pinning with digests, Renovate annotations, NPM supply-chain hardening, layer ordering, Claude Code native install, forge CLI config cleanup, git/SSH configuration, permissions (sticky bit), arbitrary UID entrypoint, and worktree compatibility.

Key principles:
- Pin every image with `tag@sha256:digest`
- Every versioned dependency gets a `# renovate:` annotation + `ARG`
- `ENV HOME` and `ENV PATH` set **before** any tool installs
- Never set `WORKDIR` (worktree compatibility)
- `chmod 1777` not `chmod 777`
- Always pre-install the Playwright CLI (`@playwright/cli`) and Chromium/Chrome browsers, regardless of project language — required by the global `playwright-cli` skill the user uses for browser automation. See [references/dockerfile.md](references/dockerfile.md) "Playwright CLI and browsers (always include)"

If Docker support was enabled in Phase 1, also add the Docker CLI layer and `/etc/group` writable. See [references/docker-support.md](references/docker-support.md) for the Dockerfile additions and entrypoint GID handling.

### Phase 3: devcontainer.json

Generate `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Ask the user whether to share host Claude Code settings or start isolated.

See [references/devcontainer-json.md](references/devcontainer-json.md) for both paths (host settings vs isolated), mount configurations, and the rationale for each key decision (`init`, workspace mount, SSH agent, COLORTERM, dual `.claude` mount workaround).

Key decisions:
- **Path A** (host settings): dual `~/.claude` bind mount + `~/.claude.json` mount
- **Path B** (isolated): named Docker volume, no host config
- Both paths: `"init": true`, host-native `workspaceFolder`, read-only `.gitconfig`, SSH agent socket, `COLORTERM` forwarding

If Docker support was enabled in Phase 1, add the Docker socket bind-mount (`/var/run/docker.sock`). The entrypoint handles GID — no `runArgs` needed.

### Phase 4: CI Validation

Add CI jobs that run on changes to `.devcontainer/`:

**Schema validation:**

```yaml
devcontainer:validate:
  # Use python variant — bare uv image has uv as entrypoint
  image: ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:<python-variant>@sha256:<digest>
  script:
    - uvx check-jsonschema --schemafile "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devcontainers/spec/main/schemas/devContainer.schema.json" .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

**Build verification:**

```yaml
devcontainer:build:
  # requires Docker-in-Docker or equivalent
  script:
    - docker build .devcontainer/
```

Both jobs should only trigger on changes to `.devcontainer/*` or the CI file itself.

### Phase 5: Network Firewall (Optional)

**Ask the user:** will this container be used for autonomous/sandbox mode? If not, skip this phase — the firewall breaks normal development.

See [references/firewall.md](references/firewall.md) for complete firewall implementation: allowlist file generation (auto-detected from Phase 1 registries/forge), `firewall.sh` script, Dockerfile additions (iptables, ipset, gosu), entrypoint modifications (firewall + privilege drop via gosu), and devcontainer.json additions for IDE-based firewall mode.

Key principles:
- Allowlist file with domains, resolved to IPs at startup
- Default DROP policy, allow only DNS/SSH/HTTP/HTTPS to listed domains
- Self-test (verify blocked domain is unreachable)
- `gosu` for privilege drop after firewall setup
- Always include `registry.npmjs.org` and `github.com` regardless of project

If Docker support was enabled in Phase 1, add Docker Hub registry domains (`registry-1.docker.io`, `auth.docker.io`, `production.cloudflare.docker.com`) to the allowlist. Scan project Dockerfiles and compose files for additional registries. See [references/docker-support.md](references/docker-support.md).

### Phase 6: Task Runner Integration

**Wrap the container launch** in a task runner recipe so the entry point is `just dev-shell` (or equivalent).

See [references/task-runner.md](references/task-runner.md) for detection logic, recipe structure, and the `--firewall` flag for firewalled autonomous mode.

Key principles:
- Detect existing task runner (justfile, Makefile, Taskfile.yml, package.json)
- Ask user before adding recipes
- Conditional mounts (only mount configs that exist on host)
- TTY auto-detection
- `--firewall` flag for opt-in firewall mode
- Single recipe, not separate isolated/full variants

If Docker support was enabled in Phase 1, add a conditional Docker socket mount with `--group-add` to the recipe. See [references/docker-support.md](references/docker-support.md).

### Phase 7: Testing

Run verifications inside the built container using the task runner recipe from Phase 6 (e.g., `just dev-shell <command>`). If no task runner was configured, use `docker run` directly.

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] All language toolchain commands work (compiler, package manager)
- [ ] `whoami` resolves (entrypoint injected passwd entry for arbitrary UID)
- [ ] `git status` works with arbitrary UID
- [ ] PID 1 is `tini`/`docker-init` (check `cat /proc/1/cmdline`)
- [ ] Git identity resolves from read-only `.gitconfig` (`git config user.name`)
- [ ] `.gitconfig` is not writable (`git config --global user.name test` should fail)
- [ ] NPM hardening envs are set (`NPM_CONFIG_IGNORE_SCRIPTS=true`, `NPM_CONFIG_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE=1440`)
- [ ] SSH agent is accessible (`ssh-add -l` lists keys)
- [ ] SSH-based git operations work (`git ls-remote` or `ssh -T git@<forge>`)
- [ ] Forge CLI authenticates with mounted config
- [ ] `claude --version` works with mounted config
- [ ] `claude plugin list` shows all plugins enabled (Path A only)
- [ ] `playwright-cli --version` works (global `@playwright/cli` on `$PATH`)
- [ ] `playwright-cli open about:blank` then `playwright-cli close-all` succeeds (browsers pre-installed and reachable)
- [ ] Any project-specific build commands succeed

**Docker verification (Docker support only):**
- [ ] `docker version` — CLI installed, daemon reachable via socket
- [ ] `docker compose version` — compose plugin installed
- [ ] `docker buildx version` — buildx plugin installed
- [ ] `docker info` — full daemon connectivity
- [ ] `docker run --rm hello-world` — end-to-end pull + run + cleanup
- [ ] `docker build -t test-build - <<< 'FROM alpine' && docker rmi test-build` — can build images
- [ ] If firewall enabled: `docker pull alpine` succeeds (Docker Hub allowlisted)

**Firewall verification (Phase 5 only):**

Run with the firewall flag (e.g., `just dev-shell --firewall <command>`):
- [ ] `curl https://example.com` is rejected (firewall blocks unlisted domains)
- [ ] `curl https://api.anthropic.com` succeeds (Claude API is allowed)
- [ ] `ssh -T git@<forge>` succeeds (forge SSH is allowed)
- [ ] `firewall-list` shows resolved IPs
- [ ] `whoami` still resolves (gosu dropped to correct UID)
- [ ] `id -u` matches host UID (privilege drop worked)
